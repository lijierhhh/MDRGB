# MDRGBSR
The code for paper Multilayer Degradation Representation-Guided Blind Super-Resolution for Remote Sensing Images

# Dataset
In this work, two widely used remote sensing datasets, i.e., [AID](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05167v1) and [WHU-RS19](http://www.escience.cn/people/yangwen/WHU-RS19.html), are adopted,in which the AID dataset is employed to train the proposed model and the WHU-RS19 dataset is used to test the SR performance of all considered approaches.

# Usage
You can add the network model ([MDRGB.py](https://github.com/lijierhhh/MDRGBSR/blob/main/MDRGB.py)) to the framework you designed for training, or you can refer to the open source framework code of RCAN.
