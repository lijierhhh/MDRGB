# MDRGB
The code for paper Multilayer Degradation Representation-Guided Blind Super-Resolution for Remote Sensing Images

#Dataset
In this work, two widely used remote sensing datasets, i.e., AID and WHU-RS19, are adopted,in which the AID dataset is employed to train the proposed model and the WHU-RS19 dataset is used to test the SR performance of all considered approaches.

#Usage
You can add the open source network model (MDRGB.py) to the framework you designed for training, or you can refer to the open source framework code of RCAN.
